**[Nicolas Louviaux]** is a PhD student that arrived in TIMC laboratory in february 2024. His research subject is about the interactions between migrating cells and their surrounding environment (the extra-cellular matrix). In order to displace their nucleus, cells anchor to the substrate and contract their cytoskeleton yielding traction forces exerted on the matrix. Those forces deform the substrate and modify its mechanical properties (such as stiffness), which in turn bias the direction of motion of cells, for example in the direction of higher stiffness (e.g. durotaxis). The objective of the thesis is to study a long range communication between migrating cells through the matrix deformations using a bio-mechanical model of cell coupled with a deformable substrate modelled using finite elements method.
