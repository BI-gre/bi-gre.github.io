My name is Quentin FERNANDEZ DE GRADO, and I am currently in the second year of my PhD at TIMC, within the MAGe team. My thesis aims to enhance our knowledge of the evolutionary mechanisms impacting an organism's journey toward adaptation. First, we will study the selective pressures that shape the order of genes in operons. Second, we will investigate the evolutionary mechanisms that affect the evolution of a population's mutation rate, and the impact on the genome organization.
