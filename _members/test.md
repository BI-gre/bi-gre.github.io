**[Magali Richard](https://magrichard.github.io/)**  was initially trained in biology (experimental genetics and cell biology). During her postdoc, she joined a multidisciplinary team made up of biologists, computer scientists and statisticians to learn how to develop biostatistical approaches to analyse high-throughput omic data. Then she became interested in the evolution of tumor as a complex heterogeneous ecosystem. In 2018, she joined the team ’Methods and Algorithm for Genomics (MAGe)’ as a CNRS researcher to tackle this question through the development of novel dedicated computational approaches.
