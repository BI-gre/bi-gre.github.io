# BiGre Days: February, 20th, 2025 @ IMAG

Join us for the BiGre Days, a one-day conference bringing together the vibrant
community of computational biology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and
biophysics in Grenoble. The event will feature two invited speakers, as well
as a series of oral presentations and a poster session showcasing exciting
research.

We aim to provide a platform for young local researchers to share their work
and foster collaboration.

*The event is free but registration is mandatory*.
