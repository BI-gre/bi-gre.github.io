- [ ] Check that the rooms are booked
    - Website on which to book the rooms: https://batiment.imag.fr/public/planning-imag/
    - Rooms to book:
        - Seminaire 1
	- espace convivialité
	- amphi pour l'après-midi

- [ ] Book the coffee break (Greener and cheaper version)
    - Book the TIMC coffee machine (Ask Angélique Brouta - her office is in Taillefer/room 62) (Florence is in charge)
    - Bring it to the cowork and return it cleaned to Angélique (Florence is in charge)
    - Recipe for the coffee : 2L water + 2 spoons of coffee
    - Bring coffee and snacks for ~20 people (Elise is in charge until December '24)
    - Bring a kettle + tea (Emma is in charge)
    - Reminder to everyone to BYOC (bring your own cup) (people in charge of the organization)

- [ ] Book the coffee break (Traiteur version -outdated)
    - Ask for at least two quotes (we typically ask Gelin traiteur and la
      pause gourmande)
    - Choose one
    - Ask your favorise PI for a "bon de commande"
    - Reserve !

- [ ] If external / internal participation, make sure to remind whoever is
  speaking to prepare something.

- [ ] Send email reminders
